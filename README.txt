Pre-requisites for the bot:

1. Python

Setup:

1. Please open the config.ini file and go through the different informations there, most importantly for
   the bot to run, you should add your private key and your wallet address, the rest is pre-configured, you
   can change it if you wish to do so.

2. Depending on your operating system (.bat for windows, .command for mac, Linux you can figure it out ;-) edit the file
   (you can do that by opening it with a text editor) to contain the path to the folder containing this file.
   For example /users/ricktoshi/trade-cost-average-bot/

3. (Mac) Give the script permission to run, to do this open "terminal" and type in "chmod u+x ", then drag and drop the
    folder (not this text file but the "trade-cost-average-bot" folder) to the terminal window. + press enter
